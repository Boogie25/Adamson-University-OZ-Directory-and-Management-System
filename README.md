# Adamson University - OZ Building Campus Directory and Management System
A modular C++ console application developed for Programming Logic and Design. This project features a custom-built utility library and persistent data storage to manage campus departmental information.

Key Technical Features
Custom Utility Library (oz_lib): A modular library created to handle core data processing and string manipulation, ensuring clean and reusable code.


File Persistence: Uses C++ File I/O streams to store and retrieve directory data, allowing for consistent data management across system restarts.

Modular Architecture: Separates system logic (main.cpp) from utility functions (oz_lib.cpp), demonstrating an understanding of modular software design.

Procedural Logic: Developed using advanced control structures and function-based programming in CLion with a CMake build system.
